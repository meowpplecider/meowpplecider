### Hi there 👋

#### My name is Gwen. I'm a trans-woman from Indiana with 5 years of IT experience (mostly focused in support and network administration).
#### I'm consistently learning and have grand goals to be a cloud engineer with a focus on cybersecurity! I am very passionate about accessibility and writing clean, tight code that can be easily understood by other engineers.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Terraform for CI/CD Pipeline management.
